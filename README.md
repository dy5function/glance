# Glance - An OpenGL boilerplate project

## Summary

*Glance* is boilerplate OpenGL project structure that I am developing for personal projects and that I want anybody to freely use for their purposes. This project is heavily inspired by [Glitter](http://polytonic.github.io/Glitter/), so make sure to check out this project as well!
