# Glance - An OpenGL boilerplate project

[![CMake](https://github.com/dy5function/glance/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dy5function/glance/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)

## Summary

*Glance* is a boilerplate OpenGL project structure that I am developing for personal projects and want anybody to freely use for their purposes. This project is heavily inspired by [Glitter](http://polytonic.github.io/Glitter/), so make sure to check out this project as well!

## Building Glance

*Glance* currently supports building on *Linux* via [cmake](https://cmake.org/). From the project root run the following:

```bash
# Create build directory and changedir into it
mkdir build
cd build

# Generate makefile
cmake ..

# Build Glance and dependencies
make
```
